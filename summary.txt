During the simulation i learned that customers wait time changes based on how mant checkers are working.
The more checkers there were, the less wait time. But, the checkers have more idle time.
I also learned how to track extra data like how many shoppers were served and the average
number of items bought.i made changes by increasing the number of items shoppers could buy
by adjusting the number of checkers and see how it affected the results. I added extra data to find 
how many shopers were served and the average number of items they bought.
Based on the assumptions in the code, such as shoppers arriving every 2 minutes, shoppting time depending on the number of tems, and checkers ringing up to 10 items per 
minute, i would reccomend having enough checkers to keep wait times low without creating too much idle time. Around 5 to 8 checkers.
